0,what is the asset turnover ratio?,"The asset turnover ratio measures the value of a company's sales or revenues relative to the value of its assets. The asset turnover ratio can be used as an indicator of the efficiency with which a company is using its assets to generate revenue. The higher the asset turnover ratio, the more efficient a company is at generating revenue from its assets. Conversely, if a company has a low asset turnover ratio, it indicates it is not efficiently using its assets to generate sales."
1,formula and calculation of the asset turnover ratio,﻿                Asset Turnover   =     Total Sales       Beginning Assets       +       Ending Assets     2                     where:                 Total Sales   =   Annual sales total                 Beginning Assets   =   Assets at start of year                 Ending Assets   =   Assets at end of year         \begin{aligned} &\text{Asset Turnover} = \frac{ \text{Total Sales} }{ \frac { \text{Beginning Assets}\ +\ \text{Ending Assets} }{ 2 } } \\ &\textbf{where:}\\ &\text{Total Sales} = \text{Annual sales total} \\ &\text{Beginning Assets} = \text{Assets at start of year} \\ &\text{Ending Assets} = \text{Assets at end of year} \\ \end{aligned}   ​Asset Turnover=2Beginning Assets + Ending Assets​Total Sales​where:Total Sales=Annual sales totalBeginning Assets=Assets at start of yearEnding Assets=Assets at end of year​﻿
2,what the asset turnover ratio can tell you,"The asset turnover ratio uses the value of a company's assets in the denominator of the formula. To determine the value of a company's assets, the average value of the assets for the year needs to first be calculated. Typically, the asset turnover ratio is calculated on an annual basis. The higher the asset turnover ratio, the better the company is performing, since higher ratios imply that the company is generating more revenue per dollar of assets. The asset turnover ratio tends to be higher for companies in certain sectors than in others. Retail and consumer staples, for example, have relatively small asset bases but have high sales volume—thus, they have the highest average asset turnover ratio. Conversely, firms in sectors such as utilities and real estate have large asset bases and low asset turnover. Since this ratio can vary widely from one industry to the next, comparing the asset turnover ratios of a retail company and a telecommunications company would not be very productive. Comparisons are only meaningful when they are made for different companies within the same sector."
3,what is the enterprise value to free cash flow ratio,"The Enterprise Value (EV) to Free Cash Flow (FCF) compares company valuation with its potential to create positive cash flow statements. Here EV represents the total market value of a company’s share price times the number of shares outstanding, also referred to as market cap, plus debt, minus cash. FCF represents a firm’s net cash earned minus its capital expenditures."
4,formula and calculation of the enterprise value to free cash flow ratio,The formula of Asset Turnover Ratio is Enterprise Value divided by Free Cash Flow
5,what the enterprise value to free cash flow ratio,"When the enterprise’s ratio to free cash flow is low, it means the company can pay back the cost of its acquisition rather quickly. If one is comparing firms, lower multiples are higher in value as compared to higher multiples. It may also generate revenue for reinvestment in the business. The enterprise value is probably one of the accurate means of assessing the firm’s value considering it would include the debt and value of the preferred shares and minority interest. Though, it is minus the cash and cash equivalent"
6,what is the current ratio?,"The current ratio is a liquidity ratio that measures a company’s ability to pay short-term obligations or those due within one year. It tells investors and analysts how a company can maximize the current assets on its balance sheet to satisfy its current debt and other payables.A current ratio that is in line with the industry average or slightly higher is generally considered acceptable. A current ratio that is lower than the industry average may indicate a higher risk of distress or default. Similarly, if a company has a very high current ratio compared with its peer group, it indicates that management may not be using its assets efficiently.The current ratio is called current because, unlike some other liquidity ratios, it incorporates all current assets and current liabilities. The current ratio is sometimes called the working capital ratio."
7,formula and calculation for the current ratio,"To calculate the ratio, analysts compare a company’s current assets to its current liabilities.Current assets listed on a company’s balance sheet include cash, accounts receivable, inventory, and other current assets (OCA) that are expected to be liquidated or turned into cash in less than one year.Current liabilities include accounts payable, wages, taxes payable, short-term debts, and the current portion of long-term debt.Current Ratio   =    Current assets   Current liabilities         \begin{aligned} &\text{Current Ratio}=\frac{\text{Current assets}}{ \text{Current liabilities}} \end{aligned}   ​Current Ratio=Current liabilitiesCurrent assets​​"
8,understanding the current ratio,"The current ratio measures a company’s ability to pay current, or short-term, liabilities (debts and payables) with its current, or short-term, assets, such as cash, inventory, and receivables.In many cases, a company with a current ratio of less than 1.00 does not have the capital on hand to meet its short-term obligations if they were all due at once, while a current ratio greater than 1.00 indicates that the company has the financial resources to remain solvent in the short term. However, because the current ratio at any one time is just a snapshot, it is usually not a complete representation of a company’s short-term liquidity or longer-term solvency.For example, a company may have a very high current ratio, but its accounts receivable may be very aged, perhaps because its customers pay slowly, which may be hidden in the current ratio. Some of the accounts receivable may even need to be written off. Analysts also must consider the quality of a company’s other assets vs. its obligations. If the inventory is unable to be sold, the current ratio may still look acceptable at one point in time, even though the company may be headed for default."
9,interpreting the current ratio,"A ratio under 1.00 indicates that the company’s debts due in a year or less are greater than its assets—cash or other short-term assets expected to be converted to cash within a year or less. A current ratio of less than 1.00 may seem alarming, although different situations can negatively affect the current ratio in a solid company.For example, a normal cycle for the company’s collections and payment processes may lead to a high current ratio as payments are received, but a low current ratio as those collections ebb. Calculating the current ratio at just one point in time could indicate that the company can’t cover all of its current debts, but it doesn’t necessarily mean that it won’t be able to when the payments are due.Additionally, some companies, especially larger retailers such as Walmart, have been able to negotiate much longer-than-average payment terms with their suppliers. If a retailer doesn’t offer credit to its customers, this can show on its balance sheet as a high payables balance relative to its receivables balance. Large retailers can also minimize their inventory volume through an efficient supply chain, which makes their current assets shrink against current liabilities, resulting in a lower current ratio. Walmart’s current ratio as of July 2021 was 0.96.In theory, the higher the current ratio, the more capable a company is of paying its obligations because it has a larger proportion of short-term asset value relative to the value of its short-term liabilities. However, though a high ratio—say, more than 3.00—could indicate that the company can cover its current liabilities three times, it also may indicate that it is not using its current assets efficiently, securing financing very well, or properly managing its working capital.The current ratio can be a useful measure of a company’s short-term solvency when it is placed in the context of what has been historically normal for the company and its peer group. It also offers more insight when calculated repeatedly over several periods."
10,what is inventory turnover?,"Inventory turnover is a financial ratio showing how many times a company has sold and replaced inventory during a given period. A company can then divide the days in the period by the inventory turnover formula to calculate the days it takes to sell the inventory on hand.Calculating inventory turnover can help businesses make better decisions on pricing, manufacturing, marketing, and purchasing new inventory."
11,inventory turnover formula and calculation,"Inventory Turnover   =    COGS   Average Value of Inventory                  where:                 COGS   =   Cost of goods sold        \begin{aligned} &\text{Inventory Turnover} = \frac{ \text{COGS} }{ \text{Average Value of Inventory} } \\ &\textbf{where:} \\ &\text{COGS} = \text{Cost of goods sold} \\ \end{aligned}   ​Inventory Turnover=Average Value of InventoryCOGS​where:COGS=Cost of goods sold​and:Companies can also calculate inventory turnover by:As you can see above, there are two main methods to calculate inventory turnover: one using the cost of goods sold (COGS) and the other using sales. Analysts divide COGS by average inventory, instead of sales, for greater accuracy in the inventory turnover calculation because sales include a markup over cost. Dividing sales by average inventory inflates inventory turnover. In both situations, average inventory is used to help remove seasonality effects."
12,what inventory turnover can tell you,"Inventory turnover measures how fast a company sells inventory. A low turnover implies weak sales and possibly excess inventory, also known as overstocking. It may indicate a problem with the goods being offered for sale or be a result of too little marketing.A high ratio, on the other hand, implies either strong sales or insufficient inventory. The former is desirable while the latter could lead to lost business.The speed at which a company can sell inventory is a critical measure of business performance. Retailers that move inventory out faster tend to outperform. The longer an item is held, the higher its holding cost will be, and the fewer reasons consumers will have to return to the shop for new items.A good example can be seen in the fast fashion business. Companies such as H&M and Zara typically limit runs and replace depleted inventory quickly with new items. Slow-selling items equate to higher holding costs compared to the faster-selling inventory. There is also the opportunity cost of low inventory turnover; an item that takes a long time to sell prevents the placement of newer items that may sell more readily."
13,example of how to use inventory turnover,"Assume Company ABC has $1 million in sales and $250,000 in COGS. The average inventory is $25,000. Using this information, we can see that the company has an inventory turnover of 40 or $1 million divided by $25,000. In other words, within a year Company ABC tends to turn over its inventory 40 times.Taking it a step further, dividing 365 days by the inventory turnover shows how many days on average it takes a company to sell its inventory. In the case of Company ABC, it’s 9.1.Alternatively, using the other method—COGS / average inventory—the inventory turnover is 10, or $250,000 in COGS divided by $25,000 in inventory. Inventory is on hand for 36.5 days under this approach, or 365 / 10."
14,what is a long-term debt to equity ratio?,The long-term debt to equity ratio is a comparison between a company’s long-term debts and shareholders’ equity. This ratio indicates how much the company owes and its proportion in comparison to shareholders’ equity.
15,why is the long-term debt to equity ratio important?,"The long-term debt to equity ratio helps you analyze the company’s financial situation. This information can be vital in determining whether an investment would bring about positive returns on your money. Also, this ratio shows what part of the business you own (or will own in the future)."
16,what is the formula for the long-term debt to equity ratio?,The formula for the long-term debt to equity ratio is: LTD/E = Shareholders’ Equity / Long Term Debt
17,why do companies have long-term debt?,"Long-term debt helps a company expand its operations by using it for capital-intensive plans. For example, you can build factories, purchase more inventories, and add equipment. These things require a lot of money, so you can use long-term debt to pay for them over time."
18,what is a good long-term debt to equity ratio?,"There isn’t a universal ""good"" or average long-term debt to equity ratio, but it should be at least 3% of total assets for small businesses. Large companies should have more than 40% of long-term debt to equity."
19,what is a pretax profit margin?,"The pretax profit margin is a financial accounting tool used to measure the operating efficiency of a company. It is a ratio that tells us the percentage of sales that has turned into profits or, in other words, how many cents of profit the business has generated for each dollar of sale before deducting taxes. The pretax profit margin is widely used to compare the profitability of businesses within the same industry."
20,how pretax profit margin works,"Companies across the globe strive to generate as much profit as possible. For investors, one of the most common and useful measures to gauge corporate profitability is to look at profit margins. Consistently high pretax profit margins are a sign of a healthy company with an efficient business model and pricing power. Low pretax profit margins suggest the opposite.To boost profitability, management teams must strike a balance between increasing sales and reducing costs. Pretax profit margins give us an indicator of how successful companies are at achieving this goal. As a result, they are closely watched by analysts and investors and frequently referred to in financial statements.Pretax profit margin only requires two pieces of information from the income statement: revenues and income before taxes. The percentage ratio is calculated by deducting all expenses except for taxes, found in the income before taxes figure, dividing it by sales and then multiplying the resulting number by 100.Alternatively, the pretax profit margin can be calculated by adding taxes back to net income (NI) or by dividing net income by '1 minus the effective tax-rate' and then dividing by sales."
21,pretax margin example,"Company EZ Supply has an annual gross profit of $100,000. It has operating expenses of $50,000, interest expenses of $10,000, and sales totaling $500,000. The calculation of earnings before taxes is from subtracting the operating and interest costs from the gross profit ($100,000 - $60,000). EZ Supply has pretax earnings of $40,000, and total sales of $500,000 for the given fiscal year (FY). The pretax profit margin is calculated by dividing pretax earnings by sales, resulting in a ratio of 8%."
22,advantages of pretax profit margin,"The pretax profit margin offers investors one of the best ways to compare competing companies, as well as those with significant differences in size and scale, in the same industry. Often, profit margins after taxes gains more prominence among analysts and investors. However, it can be argued that tax payments offer little insight into the efficiency of companies and should, therefore, be stripped out of the equation.Tax expenditures can make profitability comparisons between companies misleading. Tax rates vary from state to state, are generally out of management’s control and aren’t necessarily a fair reflection of how a business is performing.At times, the tax expense can be more substantial in a current year than in previous years due to tax penalties and new legislation imposing higher tax rates. Alternatively, the present tax expense may be much lower than it had been in earlier years due to tax credits, deductions, and tax breaks. In this case, analysts may be able to decrease earnings volatility by calculating the pretax profit margin."
23,what is the quick ratio?,"The quick ratio is an indicator of a company’s short-term liquidity position and measures a company’s ability to meet its short-term obligations with its most liquid assets.Since it indicates the company’s ability to instantly use its near-cash assets (assets that can be converted quickly to cash) to pay down its current liabilities, it is also called the acid test ratio. An ""acid test"" is a slang term for a quick test designed to produce instant results."
24,understanding the quick ratio,"The quick ratio measures the dollar amount of liquid assets available against the dollar amount of current liabilities of a company. Liquid assets are those current assets that can be quickly converted into cash with minimal impact on the price received in the open market, while current liabilities are a company's debts or obligations that are due to be paid to creditors within one year.A result of 1 is considered to be the normal quick ratio. It indicates that the company is fully equipped with exactly enough assets to be instantly liquidated to pay off its current liabilities. A company that has a quick ratio of less than 1 may not be able to fully pay off its current liabilities in the short term, while a company having a quick ratio higher than 1 can instantly get rid of its current liabilities. For instance, a quick ratio of 1.5 indicates that a company has $1.50 of liquid assets available to cover each $1 of its current liabilities.While such numbers-based ratios offer insight into the viability and certain aspects of a business, they may not provide a complete picture of the overall health of the business. It is important to look at other associated measures to assess the true picture of a company's financial health."
25,formula for the quick ratio,"To calculate the quick ratio, locate each of the formula components on a company's balance sheet in the current assets and current liabilities sections. Plug the corresponding balance into the equation and perform the calculation.While calculating the quick ratio, double-check the constituents you're using in the formula. The numerator of liquid assets should include the assets that can be easily converted to cash in the short-term (within 90 days or so) without compromising on their price. Inventory is not included in the quick ratio because many companies, in order to sell through their inventory in 90 days or less, would have to apply steep discounts to incentivize customers to buy quickly. Inventory includes raw materials, components, and finished products.Similarly, only accounts receivables that can be collected within about 90 days should be considered. Accounts receivable refers to the money that is owed to a company by its customers for goods or services already delivered."
26,customer payment impact on the quick ratio,"A business may have a large amount of money as accounts receivable, which may bump up the quick ratio. However, if the payment from the customer is delayed due to unavoidable circumstances, or if the payment has a due date that is a long period out, such as 120 days based on terms of sale, the company may not be able to meet its short-term liabilities. This may include essential business expenses and accounts payable that need immediate payment. Despite having a healthy accounts receivable balance, the quick ratio might actually be too low, and the business could be at risk of running out of cash.On the other hand, a company could negotiate rapid receipt of payments from its customers and secure longer terms of payment from its suppliers, which would keep liabilities on the books longer. By converting accounts receivable to cash faster, it may have a healthier quick ratio and be fully equipped to pay off its current liabilities.Whether accounts receivable is a source of quick, ready cash remains a debatable topic, and depends on the credit terms that the company extends to its customers. A company that needs advance payments or allows only 30 days to the customers for payment will be in a better liquidity position than a company that gives 90 days. Additionally, a company’s credit terms with its suppliers also affect its liquidity position. If a company gives its customers 60 days to pay but has 120 days to pay its suppliers, its liquidity position will be healthy as long as its receivables match or exceed its payables.The other two components, cash & cash equivalents and marketable securities, are usually free from such time-bound dependencies. However, to maintain precision in the calculation, one should consider only the amount to be actually received in 90 days or less under normal terms. Early liquidation or premature withdrawal of assets like interest-bearing securities may lead to penalties or discounted book value."
27,example of quick ratio,"Publicly traded companies generally report the quick ratio figure under the “Liquidity/Financial Health” heading in the “Key Ratios” section of their quarterly reports.Below is the calculation of the quick ratio based on the figures that appear on the balance sheets of two leading competitors operating in the personal care industrial sector, P&G and J&J, for the fiscal year ending in 2021 and 2020 respectively.With a quick ratio of 0.91, Johnson & Johnson appears to be in a decent position to cover its current liabilities, though its liquid assets aren't quite able to meet each dollar of short-term obligations. Procter & Gamble, on the other hand, may not be able to pay off its current obligations using only quick assets as its quick ratio is well below 1, at 0.45."
28,what is return on assets (roa)?,"The term return on assets (ROA) refers to a financial ratio that indicates how profitable a company is in relation to its total assets. Corporate management, analysts, and investors can use ROA to determine how efficiently a company uses its assets to generate a profit.The metric is commonly expressed as a percentage by using a company's net income and its average assets. A higher ROA means a company is more efficient and productive at managing its balance sheet to generate profits while a lower ROA indicates there is room for improvement."
29,understanding return on assets (roa),"Businesses are about efficiency. Comparing profits to revenue is a useful operational metric, but comparing them to the resources a company used to earn them displays the feasibility of that company's existence. Return on assets is the simplest of such corporate bang-for-the-buck measures. It tells you what earnings are generated from invested capital or assets.ROA for public companies can vary substantially and are highly dependent on the industry in which they function so the ROA for a tech company won't necessarily correspond to that of a food and beverage company. This is why when using ROA as a comparative measure, it is best to compare it against a company's previous ROA numbers or a similar company's ROA.The ROA figure gives investors an idea of how effective the company is in converting the money it invests into net income. The higher the ROA number, the better, because the company is able to earn more money with a smaller investment. Put simply, a higher ROA means more asset efficiency."
30,return on assets (roa) vs. return on equity (roe),"Both ROA and return on equity (ROE) measure how well a company utilizes its resources. But one of the key differences between the two is how they each treat a company's debt. ROA factors in how leveraged a company is or how much debt it carries. After all, its total assets include any capital it borrows to run its operations.On the other hand, ROE only measures the return on a company’s equity, which leaves out its liabilities. Thus, ROA accounts for a company’s debt and ROE does not. The more leverage and debt a company takes on, the higher ROE will be relative to ROA. Thus, as a company takes on more debt, its ROE would be higher than its ROA.Assuming returns are constant, assets are now higher than equity and the denominator of the return on assets calculation is higher because assets are higher. This means that a company's ROA falls while its ROE stays at its previous level."
31,limitations of roa,"As noted above, one of the biggest issues with ROA is that it can't be used across industries. That’s because companies in one industry have different asset bases than those in another. So the asset bases of companies within the oil and gas industry aren't the same as those in the retail industry.Some analysts also feel that the basic ROA formula is limited in its applications, being most suitable for banks. Bank balance sheets better represent the real value of their assets and liabilities because they’re carried at market value via mark-to-market accounting (or at least an estimate of market value) versus historical cost. Both interest expense and interest income are already factored into the equation."
32,what is the formula of return on asset?,"ROA is calculated by dividing a company’s net income by its total assets. As a formula, it's expressed as Net Income divided by Total Assets"
33,what is return on equity (roe)?,"Return on equity (ROE) is a measure of financial performance calculated by dividing net income by shareholders' equity. Because shareholders' equity is equal to a company’s assets minus its debt, ROE is considered the return on net assets. ROE is considered a gauge of a corporation's profitability and how efficient it is in generating profits. The higher the ROE, the more efficient a company's management is at generating income and growth from its equity financing."
34,what return on equity tells you?,"Whether an ROE is deemed good or bad will depend on what is normal among a stock’s peers. For example, utilities have many assets and debt on the balance sheet compared to a relatively small amount of net income. A normal ROE in the utility sector could be 10% or less. A technology or retail firm with smaller balance sheet accounts relative to net income may have normal ROE levels of 18% or more. A good rule of thumb is to target an ROE that is equal to or just above the average for the company's sector—those in the same business. For example, assume a company, TechCo, has maintained a steady ROE of 18% over the past few years compared to the average of its peers, which was 15%. An investor could conclude that TechCo’s management is above average at using the company’s assets to create profits. Relatively high or low ROE ratios will vary significantly from one industry group or sector to another. Still, a common shortcut for investors is to consider a return on equity near the long-term average of the S&P 500 (14%) as an acceptable ratio and anything less than 10% as poor."
35,roe and a sustainable growth rate,"Assume that there are two companies with identical ROEs and net income but different retention ratios. This means they will each have a different sustainable growth rate (SGR). The SGR is the rate a company can grow without having to borrow money to finance that growth. The formula for calculating SGR is ROE times the retention ratio (or ROE times one minus the payout ratio). For example, Company A has an ROE of 15% and has a retention ratio of 70%. Business B also has an ROE of 15% but has a 90% retention ratio. For Company A, the sustainable growth rate is 10.5% (15% * 70%). Business B's SGR is 13.5% (15% * 90%). A stock that is growing at a slower rate than its sustainable rate could be undervalued, or the market may be accounting for key risks. In either case, a growth rate that is far above or below the sustainable rate warrants additional investigation."
36,using return on equity to identify problems,"It's reasonable to wonder why an average or slightly above-average ROE is preferable rather than an ROE that is double, triple, or even higher than the average of its peer group. Aren’t stocks with a very high ROE a better value? Sometimes an extremely high ROE is a good thing if net income is extremely large compared to equity because a company’s performance is so strong. However, an extremely high ROE is often due to a small equity account compared to net income, which indicates risk."
37,return on equity vs. return on invested capital,"Though ROE looks at how much profit a company can generate relative to shareholders’ equity, return on invested capital (ROIC) takes that calculation a couple of steps further. The purpose of ROIC is to figure out the amount of money after dividends a company makes based on all its sources of capital, which includes shareholders' equity and debt. ROE looks at how well a company uses shareholders' equity while ROIC is meant to determine how well a company uses all its available capital to make money."
38,how do you calculate roe?,"To calculate ROE, analysts simply divide the company’s net income by its average shareholders’ equity. Because shareholders’ equity is equal to assets minus liabilities, ROE is essentially a measure of the return generated on the net assets of the company. Since the equity figure can fluctuate during the accounting period in question, an average shareholders’ equity is used."
39,what is a good roe?,"As with most other performance metrics, what counts as a “good” ROE will depend on the company’s industry and competitors. Though the long-term ROE for S&P 500 companies has averaged around 18.6%, specific industries can be significantly higher or lower. All else being equal, an industry will likely have a lower average ROE if it is highly competitive and requires substantial assets in order to generate revenues. On the other hand, industries with relatively few players and where only limited assets are needed to generate revenues may show a higher average ROE."
40,what is the difference between return on assets (roa) and roe?,"Return on assets (ROA) and ROE are similar in that they are both trying to gauge how efficiently the company generates its profits. However, whereas ROE compares net income to the net assets of the company, ROA compares net income to the company’s assets alone, without deducting its liabilities. In both cases, companies in industries in which operations require significant assets will likely show a lower average return."
41,what causes roe to increase?,"ROE will increase as net income increases, all else equal. Another way to boost ROE is to reduce the value of shareholders' equity. Since equity is equal to assets minus liabilities, increasing liabilities (e.g., taking on more debt financing) is one way to artificially boost ROE without necessarily increasing profitability. This can be amplified if that debt is used to engage in share buybacks, effectively reducing the amount of equity available."
42,what happens if roe is negative?,"If a company's ROE is negative, it means that there was negative net income for the period in question (i.e., a loss). This implies that shareholders are losing on their investment in the company. For new and growing companies, a negative ROE is often to be expected; however, if negative ROE persists it can be a sign of trouble."
43,what is the debt-to-equity (d/e) ratio?,"The debt-to-equity (D/E) ratio is used to evaluate a company's financial leverage and is calculated by dividing a company’s total liabilities by its shareholder equity. The D/E ratio is an important metric used in corporate finance. It is a measure of the degree to which a company is financing its operations through debt versus wholly owned funds. More specifically, it reflects the ability of shareholder equity to cover all outstanding debts in the event of a business downturn. The debt-to-equity ratio is a particular type of gearing ratio."
44,debt-to-equity (d/e) ratio formula and calculation,"The information needed for the D/E ratio is on a company's balance sheet. The balance sheet requires total shareholder equity to equal assets minus liabilities.These balance sheet categories may contain individual accounts that would not normally be considered “debt” or “equity” in the traditional sense of a loan or the book value of an asset. Because the ratio can be distorted by retained earnings/losses, intangible assets, and pension plan adjustments, further research is usually needed to understand a company’s true leverage. Because of the ambiguity of some of the accounts in the primary balance sheet categories, analysts and investors will often modify the D/E ratio to be more useful and easier to compare between different stocks. Analysis of the D/E ratio can also be improved by including short-term leverage ratios, profit performance, and growth expectations."
45,what does the debt-to-equity (d/e) ratio tell you?,"Given that the D/E ratio measures a company’s debt relative to the value of its net assets, it is most often used to gauge the extent to which a company is taking on debt as a means of leveraging its assets. A high D/E ratio is often associated with high risk; it means that a company has been aggressive in financing its growth with debt. If a lot of debt is used to finance growth, a company could potentially generate more earnings than it would have without that financing. If leverage increases earnings by a greater amount than the debt’s cost (interest), then shareholders should expect to benefit. However, if the cost of debt financing outweighs the increased income generated, share values may decline. The cost of debt can vary with market conditions. Thus, unprofitable borrowing may not be apparent at first. Changes in long-term debt and assets tend to have the greatest impact on the D/E ratio because they tend to be larger accounts compared to short-term debt and short-term assets. If investors want to evaluate a company’s short-term leverage and its ability to meet debt obligations that must be paid over a year or less, they can use other ratios."
46,modifications to the debt-to-equity (d/e) ratio,"The shareholders' equity portion of the balance sheet is equal to the total value of assets minus liabilities, but that isn’t the same thing as assets minus the debt associated with those assets. A common approach to resolving this issue is to modify the D/E ratio into the long-term D/E ratio. An approach like this helps an analyst focus on important risks. Short-term debt is still part of the overall leverage of a company, but because these liabilities will be paid in a year or less, they aren’t as risky. For example, imagine a company with $1 million in short-term payables (wages, accounts payable, and notes, etc.) and $500,000 in long-term debt, compared to a company with $500,000 in short-term payables and $1 million in long-term debt. If both companies have $1.5 million in shareholder equity, then they both have a D/E ratio of 1.00. On the surface, the risk from leverage is identical, but in reality, the second company is riskier. As a rule, short-term debt tends to be cheaper than long-term debt, and it is less sensitive to shifting interest rates, meaning the second company’s interest expense and cost of capital are higher. If interest rates fall, long-term debt will need to be refinanced, which can further increase costs. Rising interest rates would seem to favor the company with more long-term debt, but if the debt can be redeemed by bondholders it could still be a disadvantage."
47,debt-to-equity (d/e) ratio vs. the gearing ratio,"Gearing ratios constitute a broad category of financial ratios, of which the D/E ratio is the best example. ""Gearing"" simply refers to financial leverage. Gearing ratios focus more heavily on the concept of leverage than other ratios used in accounting or investment analysis. This conceptual focus prevents gearing ratios from being precisely calculated or interpreted with uniformity. The underlying principle generally assumes that some leverage is good, but too much places an organization at risk. At a fundamental level, gearing is sometimes differentiated from leverage. Leverage refers to the amount of debt incurred for the purpose of investing and obtaining a higher return, while gearing refers to debt along with total equity—or an expression of the percentage of company funding through borrowing. This difference is embodied in the difference between the debt ratio and the D/E ratio."
48,limitations of the debt-to-equity (d/e) ratio,"When using the D/E ratio, it is very important to consider the industry in which the company operates. Because different industries have different capital needs and growth rates, a relatively high D/E ratio may be common in one industry, while a relatively low D/E may be common in another. Utility stocks often have a very high D/E ratio compared to market averages. A utility grows slowly but is usually able to maintain a steady income stream, which allows these companies to borrow very cheaply. High-leverage ratios in slow-growth industries with stable income represent an efficient use of capital. The consumer staples or consumer non-cyclical sector tends to also have a high D/E ratio because these companies can borrow cheaply and have a relatively stable income."
49,what is a good debt-to-equity (d/e) ratio?,"What counts as a “good” debt-to-equity (D/E) ratio will depend on the nature of the business and its industry. Generally speaking, a D/E ratio below 1.0 would be seen as relatively safe, whereas ratios of 2.0 or higher would be considered risky. Some industries, such as banking, are known for having much higher D/E ratios than others. Note that a D/E ratio that is too low may actually be a negative signal, indicating that the firm is not taking advantage of debt financing to expand and grow."
50,what does a debt-to-equity (d/e) ratio of 1.5 indicate?,"A debt-to-equity ratio of 1.5 would indicate that the company in question has $1.50 of debt for every $1 of equity. To illustrate, suppose the company had assets of $2 million and liabilities of $1.2 million. Because equity is equal to assets minus liabilities, the company’s equity would be $800,000. Its D/E ratio would therefore be $1.2 million divided by $800,000, or 1.5."
51,what does it mean for d/e to be negative?,"If a company has a negative D/E ratio, this means that the company has negative shareholder equity. In other words, it means that the company has more liabilities than assets. In most cases, this is considered a very risky sign, indicating that the company may be at risk of bankruptcy. For instance, if the company in our earlier example had liabilities of $2.5 million, its D/E ratio would be -5."
52,what industries have high d/e ratios?,"In the banking and financial services sector, a relatively high D/E ratio is commonplace. Banks carry higher amounts of debt because they own substantial fixed assets in the form of branch networks. Other industries that commonly show a relatively higher ratio are capital-intensive industries, such as the airline industry or large manufacturing companies, which utilize a high level of debt financing as a common practice."
53,how can the d/e ratio be used to measure a company's riskiness?,"A higher D/E ratio may make it harder for a company to obtain financing in the future. This means that the firm may have a harder time servicing its existing debts. Very high D/Es can be indicative of a credit crisis in the future, including defaulting on loans or bonds, or even bankruptcy."
54,what is business metrics?,"Business metrics are used to track, monitor and analyze quantified measures that assess the business process’s success or failure. It helps in effective decision making for business management. It is important to note that business metrics address the business stakeholders, like; customers, managers, business owners, investors, and vendors. Business metrics give you an insight into the business before making a deep dive into the core business data. Each business department track, monitor and analyze their specific performance and key metrics. The sales department will cater to their respective metrics like sales volume, sales call, etc, while the marketing team will look after their respective metrics such as engagement, campaign costs, website traffic, etc. Many businesses and corporations talk about their favorite business metrics in the mission statements and some include them in their workflows."
55,what business metrics should you use?,"As I have mentioned above that the business metrics address the stakeholders. It depends on the type of business, industry, business departments and business size. There are so many metrics that can easily confuse you and make more problems for you in decision making. The best practice is to see what metrics your competitors are most concerned about. Then make a list and use them for your business analysis."
56,sales qualified leads,"The sales department is the heart of any business as it supplies the blood (money) to all other departments. Sales qualified leads are those prospects who have shown interest in the product you offer. These leads know your product and about to decide whether to buy your product or not. Normally the sales qualified leads (SQL) are assigned a value depending upon their purchase intent. Tracking SQL’s will help you assess the effectiveness of your marketing and gives you a brief overview of product-market-fit. The exact methodology to calculate a qualified lead, or sales qualified lead, depends on your sales funnel. This metric is a simple count of how many prospects showed interest to buy your product and helps in calculating the conversion rates."
57,open sales opportunities,"The open sales opportunities are the qualified leads with which your sales team have touched base or just started working on them. This metric will tell you about the productivity level of your sales representatives and the level of importance they give to each prospect. There is no such ballpark figure for this metric, as this depends on the sales rep skills and experience. If your sales pipeline lacks the required number of open opportunities then this shows that your sales team needs to connect with more prospects."
58,closed sales opportunities,"It tells the number of open sales opportunities that are now closed by your sales team. This could be either due to prospect lost or sales win. This is a helpful measure to know what time your sales team takes to close a prospect and gives a brief picture of the sales department’s progress. Moreover, it will show you the number of prospects that your sales rep has interacted with and closed."
59,lead response time,"It is the average time your sales rep, marketing rep or customer support rep responds to the lead. This is more easy to understand for online businesses, as in this case, it will tell you how much time you take to respond to the website leads. For example, you run an e-commerce store and a website visitor leaves a query on your contact form. You replied the lead after 15 minutes, which means your lead response time is 15 mins. The smaller the number, the better it is for the Lead Response Time metric. Josh Harcus, author of ‘A closing culture’, described how reducing the lead time helped grow his business revenue six times and reduced the sales cycle."
60,sales win rate,The sales win rate is the percentage of the open opportunities that the business has won. It can be calculated for the whole sales team or individual sales rep. If you have 200 sales opportunities and your sales team manage to win 50 among them will give a win rate of 25%. You need to make sure that you include only those opportunities to whom you have sent sales proposals and not the ones who are not contacted.
61,how to improve the sales win rate?,"If your sales win rate is low, it means that you need to revamp your sales message, sales strategy or even your sales rep needs training (like product knowledge for sales team and rapport building techniques). This metric is really useful to learn about your business success and gives you a signal if changes are required. Just keep in mind that your sales win rate depends on the sale deal size, referrals and leads availability. It is obvious that big deal size takes time to close and requires multiple touchpoints before a sales win."
62,yearly sales growth rate,It is a good way to get an insight into the sales figure in the previous years. This will tell you how your sales are increasing in terms of a yearly basis. This metric will show you a picture of how your business has grown over the years or experiencing a downward trend.
63,average sales value,"This measure will let you know about the average deal size of your sales made to the customers and how much effort will be required to break even or meet the costs. The best practice for using this measure is to segment your customers into large deals, medium deals and small deals (or as required by your business). This helps avoid skewness in the deal sizes and eliminating the effect of outliers."
64,sales cycle,"A sales cycle is the average time it takes to have a sales win. It is measured in terms of time like days, weeks or months. This measure will identify your bottlenecks and will let you know which segment in your sales funnel needs the most attention. Moreover, the sales cycle can help you identify the critical areas within your sales funnel."
65,what is the ideal sales cycle for your business?,"It solely depends on your business and industry in which you operate. This would be the result of your continuous learning and sales experience before reaching to point to identify your sales cycle. It is usually hard to convert those potential customers who have crossed the average/ideal sales cycle. This is because they may lose interest in your product or offer, and might go to your competitors."
66,website traffic,"This is a very important metric for marketers and online businesses. It is simply the number of website visitors landing on your website domain. You can divide website traffic into numerous categories like website traffic from organic search, social media, referrals, unique visitors or repeat visitors, etc. Marketers work to improve website traffic to get more eyeballs. It is the same as to get more walk-in customers in your brick and mortar store. A website is the storefront of an online business. The more users you have the more traffic you can attract to your website."
67,website traffic source,"This metric will tell you where your traffic comes from. There could thousands of different traffic sources but they all come under the categories of organic traffic, social channels, referral traffic, traffic from emails, direct traffic, and others (this can have traffic from any source other than stated above). This will help you identify which traffic sources are working well for your business so that you can capitalize on that resource and see the problem sources that are not fruitful for you."
68,absenteeism rate,This tells about how often your employee takes a day or days off. The employees may take days and take leave from work. Planned leaves are encouraged at many organizations and taking many unplanned leaves is not considered a good work practice. It is recommended to include only the unplanned leaves in the absenteeism ratio to avoid placing false blames on your employees.
69,how to calculate workers absenteeism rate?,The formula of Workers Absenteeism Rate is Total Unplanned Leaves divided by Number of working days in a given time times 100 percent
70,employee turnover ratio,Employee Turnover ratio is the rate at which your employees voluntarily leave working for your company (Fired employees are usually not included in this ratio). A 10 to 20 percent employee turnover ratio is considered acceptable but it is a good practice to benchmark the industry standards.
71,how to calculate workers employee turnover ratio?,The formula of Workers Employee Turnover is Number of employees who left working for your company divided by Total Number of Employees times 100 percent
72,employee engagement rate,"If you want to make your teams productive then you should improve employee’s engagement rate. Engaged team member works more efficiently and can prove to be much fruitful for the business. This, in short, helps in satisfying your employees more than paid incentives. Engaging employees is about to add a human touch to your work environment. You can conduct several employee meetups and engagement activities on the job to boost their morale and urge them to engage more. There is no single formula to measure the employee engagement rate but you can create a short employee engagement survey to find out how much employees and their managers feel that they are engaged on the job. You can ask about what they think about their work-life balance? And what value they value as an employee?"
73,employee satisfaction level,Employee Satisfaction metric has a slight difference with the Employee Engagement rate. An engaged employee is more willing to participate in business process improvement and put more effort to achieve business goals. While a satisfied employee helps in advocating the business brand and helps in making a positive workplace environment. Employee Satisfaction Surveys can be used to find out the employee satisfaction level on a scale of 10. Though the satisfaction level might change for each employee with time but keeping a periodic track of it helps the company to improve its employee retention rate.
74,project effectivity,"The productivity ratio can be calculated for an individual team member, whole team and cross-teams as well. Though, you need to keep different criteria of productivity depending upon each business function. As for the sales team, the input would be the number of sales calls made and output would be the number of sales-qualified leads, and similar criteria for input and output can be decided by your business management."
75,how to calculate the project effectiviy ratio?,The formula of project effectivity ratio is the output of the project divided by the input for your project
76,project earned value,The project earned value will tell you about how much value you have generated for the given project. It is simply a comparison of the work completed with the approved project budget. Project Earned Value is also sometimes referred to as ‘Budgeted Cost of Work Completed’. This metric is usually considered during the project tenure to check the progress.
77,how to calculate the project earned value?,The formula of project earned value is Percentage of Work Completed divided by Approved Budget for the Project
78,project actual cost,The project actual cost will show you the actual amount spent on the given project. All the expenditures are added to calculate the actual cost over the period.
79,how to calculate the project actual cost?,You can calculate the project actual cost by the sum of all direct costs and indirect cost
80,planned cost for the project,The planned cost is suggested in the project budget report before actually starting the project. This metric is then compared with the actual cost to see the differences.
81,how to calculate the planned cost?,The planned cost could be calculated by adding all of planned direct and indirect cost
82,cost variance,"The cost variance is a business metric that will calculate the difference between the actual and the planned costs with a given time. This will prove the effectiveness of your project planning and will tell you whether the actual cost is higher or below the planned costs. It is favorable to have a positive cost variance means that the project goes under the budget. Moreover, the planned costs also cater to the inflation rate and keep a cost margin to avoid any issues."
83,how to calculate the cost variance?,The cost variance could be calculated by planned cost minus actual cost
84,project schedule variance,In meeting the deadline your core focus will be on tracking the project schedule variance. It gives you a variance of the planned versus scheduled project. It is the difference between the Project Earned Value and the Project Planned Cost.
85,how to calculate the project schedule variance?,The formula of project schedule variance is project earned value minus planned cost for the project
86,cost performance index (cpi),It is an efficiency metric for the project that how the actual cost has performed for the project in the given time. You can calculate this index by dividing the project earned value with the actual cost.
87,how to calculate the cost performance index?,The cost performance index could be calculated by project earned value divided by project actual cost
88,what the cost performance index can tells us?,"A value of 1.0 indicates that the project performance is on target. When CPI are greater than 1.0, this indicates better-than-planned project performance, while CPI less than 1.0 indicates poorer-than-planned project performance."
89,schedule forecast,"Schedule Forecast is the prediction of the events in the future that might affect the project and it is calculated at the current time. Forecasts are usually updated based on the project performance with time. It is derived from the baseline of the schedule and calculated using the estimated time to completion (ETC). It is expressed in terms of Performance Index and Project Schedule Variance. Therefore, you will require a project calendar and schedule model to compute the forecast."
90,critical path (cp),"It is a very important term used in project management and requires much attention when projects are planned. By definition, a Critical Path (CP) represents the longest path to complete the entire project. It includes every activity that must be performed to get the desired project result. A critical refers to the scheduling order that makes a complete project. It helps in pointing out which activity could delay the project delivery date."
91,daily active users,"Apart from the revenue metrics, the active user metric is important for product growth. It is the number of users, subscribers or the number of people who have purchased your product. This metric is of more importance to the businesses that rely on the monthly or yearly subscription-based revenue model. The daily active users (DAU) metric calculates the number of unique users you have for your product, application or website per day. An active user is the one who has signed up for your product and performs some activity daily."
92,monthly active users,"Monthly active users (MAU) is a similar business and product performance metric to the daily active user. It is the number of unique or repeat visitors to your website, application (mobile, web, desktop, and tablet) per month’s time period. For monthly and daily active user’s metric, the users are identified by unique user ID or logins."
93,daily active user (dau) per monthly active user ratio,The DAU to MAU ratio calculates the stickiness of your digital product. It means that how frequently your users engage with your product. The DAU(Daily Active User)/MAU (Monthly Active User) metric is the proportion of your monthly users who engage with your product or service in a single day.
94,how to calculate daily active user (dau) per monthly active user ratio?,DAU/MAU could be calculated by Number of Daily Active Users divided by Number of Monthly Active Users
95,session duration,"The session duration KPI is easy to calculate to track the usage of your digital products. It is a measure of total time users spend on your product (website, mobile app, web app or desktop app) and divide this time with the total number of users. This metric will tell you that if your users are interested in using your app or if they are bouncing after the first session. Higher value for session duration is encouraged for better product performance."
96,how to calculate the session duration?,Session duration could be calculated by Total time users spend on your product divided by Total number of users
97,total customers,"Businesses aim to generate a healthy customer base to earn higher profits. A business should keep a track of their entire customer base (with their customer profiles) for use in planning and forecasting. Therefore, you should aim to grow your total number of existing customers each year to remain."
98,customer retention rate,This is the ratio of how many customers does your business can retain and continued to contribute to your revenues. You should aim to maintain a healthy customer retention rate to improve your customer lifetime value and grow your business.
99,how to calculate the customer retention rate?,The formula of Customer Retention Rate (CRR) is ([The Existing number of customers – No. of Customers at the start of the year] divided by number of customers at the start of the year) times 100
100,retention rate vs. churn rate,"Your customer churn rate is simply the inverse of your customer retention rate. For instance, if your retention rate is 90 percent, then your churn rate is 10 percent. The simplest way to determine your churn rate is to take the number of churned customers during a given time frame, divide it by the total number of customers at the beginning of that same time period, and then multiply the result by 100.Likewise, businesses have to decide which types of customers they should count as having churned. Say a company offers a free trial of its product and some customers cancel at the end of it. Should the company consider those customers churned even though they never had an impact on revenue? Issues like these are why it helps to use multiple customer retention metrics for building a more nuanced understanding of why some customers stay and others go."
101,how to improve customer retention rate?,"The first step for any business that wants to improve customer retention, slow customer churn, and reduce customer acquisition costs? Get a handle on customer retention metrics. A company that understands the right metrics has an easier time aligning marketing and customer service with its larger customer retention strategy. Make sure you build customer feedback into your retention strategy. Listening to the people who share their time and money with your business may not be as concrete to calculate as retention rate or a KPI, but their input will help you create a richer customer experience and lead to more returning customers."
102,customer churn rate,"It is the rate at which your customers are leaving to use your products or services and churn is the number of customers lost in the given time. Calculating customer churn is important and this depicts the performance of your entire business team including marketing, sales, product team, etc."
103,how to calculate the customer churn rate?,The formula of Customer Churn Rate is Number of customers lost divided by Number of customers at the start of the year times 100
104,average customer revenue,It is essential to know the average customer revenue to help in designing your upselling strategies used by the marketing and sales department. It is simply a measure of total revenue with the total number of customers.
105,how to calculate the average customer revenue?,The formula of Average Customer Revenue is Total Revenue divided by Total Customers
106,how to evaluate the business performance?,"You could evaluate your business performance by looking at your business plan, making SWOT analysis, and analize the company's financial performance"
107,what is swot analysis?,"A SWOT analysis is a compilation of your company’s strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats.

109,when should you perform a swot analysis?,"You can employ a SWOT analysis before you commit to any sort of company action, whether you are exploring new initiatives, revamping internal policies, considering opportunities to pivot or altering a plan midway through its execution. Sometimes it’s wise to perform a general SWOT analysis just to check on the current landscape of your business so you can improve business operations as needed. The analysis can show you the key areas where your organization is performing optimally, as well as which operations need adjustment. Don’t make the mistake of thinking about your business operations informally, in hopes that they will all come together cohesively. By taking the time to put together a formal SWOT analysis, you can see the whole picture of your business. From there, you can discover ways to improve or eliminate your company’s weaknesses and capitalize on its strengths. While the business owner should certainly be involved in creating a SWOT analysis, it is often helpful to include other team members in the process. Ask for input from a variety of team members and openly discuss any contributions made. The collective knowledge of the team will allow you to adequately analyze your business from all sides."
110,characteristics of a swot analysis,"A SWOT analysis focuses on the four elements of the acronym, allowing companies to identify the forces influencing a strategy, action or initiative. Knowing these positive and negative elements can help companies more effectively communicate what parts of a plan need to be recognized. When drafting a SWOT analysis, individuals typically create a table split into four columns to list each impacting element side by side for comparison. Strengths and weaknesses won’t typically match listed opportunities and threats verbatim, although they should correlate, since they are ultimately tied together."
111,what is business plan?,"A business plan is a document created by a company that describes the company's goals, operations, industry standing, marketing objectives, and financial projections. The information it contains can be a helpful guide in running the company. What's more, it can be a valuable tool to attract investors and obtain financing from financial institutions."
112,elements of a business plan,"The length of a business plan varies greatly from business to business. Consider fitting the basic information into a 15- to 25-page document. Then, other crucial elements that take up a lot of space—such as applications for patents—can be referenced in the main document and included as appendices.

Other factors that may go into this section include production and manufacturing processes, any patents the company may have, as well as proprietary technology. Information about research and development (R&D) can also be included here."
115,what is market analysis,"Market analysis is a firm needs a good handle on its industry as well as its target market. This section of the plan will detail a company's competition and how the company fits in the industry, along with its relative strengths and weaknesses.
